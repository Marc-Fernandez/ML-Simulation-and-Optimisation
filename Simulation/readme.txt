### DISCLAIMER: 
All code was written by me, except most part of the class creation (I added some minor functionalities to be able to pass more arguments), as it had to be relatively uniform for every group doing the project to ensure a correct output.

### BASIC EXPLANATION:
The levels refer to three sections of the exercice. On the first level, no restrictions were imposed; on the second level, a minimum order quantity (MOQ) of 500k units was imposed; and on the third level, a fixed lead time of 15 days was added on top of the MOQ policy.
The objective of the project was to curate the best ordering policy to ensure a good service level, whilst minimizing stocked units.
